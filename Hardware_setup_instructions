to start the driver
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur3e robot_ip:=192.168.0.250 launch_rviz:=true
things to note:
- ensure that the robot ip matches

then start the program on the ur3e - ensure that the driver is done setting up and has stopped printing
note:
- ensure that the return pc ip is the same as your ip: you can check this with ifconfig
- once done you should see that the driver confirms ready to receive commands

next step is to start our moveIt launch with ros2 launch ur3_test_control moveL.launch.py
note:
- to run this you need to ros package from the git symbolicaly linked to your ros2 workspace
